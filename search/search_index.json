For product details, visit https://opengarage.io . For official firmware release notes, please go to the OpenGarage Firmware Releases page on GitHub. OpenGarage's Built-in Web UI Firmware Compilation Instructions Environment Setup Download and unzip (or git clone) this ( OpenGarage-Firmware ) repository. Install the latest LTS version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ if you don't already have it. In your terminal, navigate to the OpenGarage-Firmware/OpenGarage folder (the source code folder) and run npm install html-minifier-terser . Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) from https://code.visualstudio.com/ , if you don't already have it. Launch VS Code and install the PlatformIO extension. Building the Firmware In VS Code, click File -> Open Folder and select the OpenGarage-Firmware/OpenGarage folder. PlatformIO will recognize the platformio.ini file in that folder, which contains all the libraries and settings needed to compile the firmware. Click the PlatformIO: Build button (with the checkmark icon \u2713) in the blue status bar at the bottom of the screen to build the firmware. Making Changes to the UI The built-in web UI files are located in the html subfolder. You do not need to run any scripts manually. When you build the project, a Python script ( run_prebuild.py ) automatically calls the compress_htmls.mjs script to minify, compress, and convert the HTML files into firmware program strings stored in htmls.h , which are then compiled into the final firmware. After editing any files in the html folder, simply build the project again. Firmware Update Instructions OpenGarage firmware supports OTA (over-the-air) updates, allowing you to upload the firmware directly through the web UI. Update Steps Download a firmware file (e.g. og_x.x.x.bin where x.x.x is the firmware version). Before starting, close the Blynk and OpenGarage mobile apps to prevent them from interfering with the update process. Open your OpenGarage's homepage, click Firmware Update at the bottom of the page. If your OpenGarage is in WiFi AP (Access Point) mode, the update page is available at http://192.168.4.1/update . Select the firmware file your downloaded, enter your device key, and click Submit . Wait for the process to finish. If the upload fails, you can try again. If the device hangs, unplug and replug the power, then try again. Troubleshooting Firmware Corruption : If the firmware upload fails and the device no longer boots, you'll need to re-flash the firmware using a USB-serial programmer . Flash Memory Requirement : Early OpenGarage units (v1.0, v1.1, v1.2, made before 2018) have only 2MB of flash memory. These cannot be upgraded to firmware 1.2.0 or later, which require 4MB. All newer versions (v1.3 and above) include 4MB flash and support the latest firmware. Checking Flash Size : If you are unsure how much flash memory is available on your OpenGarage, you can first update to firmware 1.1.3. After the update, open a browser and go to http://<your_og_ip>/db . This will display a JSON string. Look for the flash_size value: if it's 4194304 , you have 4MB of flash and can upgrade. If it is 2097152 , your device is not upgradeable to firmware 1.2.0 and beyond. Factory Reset Warning : Upgrading from an early firmware to version 1.2.0 will erase all setings due to changes in the flash memory layout. Be sure to write down your configuration before proceeding.

Note that sn2_value is only available if sn2 is enabled. 7. Clear Logs /clearlog Usage : http://devip/clearlog? dkey =xxx Clears the entire log data. 8. Factory Reset /resetall Usage : http://devip/resetall? dkey =xxx Resets the controller back to factory default settings. WiFi will be restored to AP (Access Point) mode. 9. MQTT To use MQTT features: Enable MQTT (set mqen=1 ) and provide server parameters (server url mqtt , port mqpt , user name mqur and password mqpw if using authentication). You may define a custom MQTT topic ( mqtp ). If left empty, the device name will be used as the topic. In the example below, the topic is referred to as OGTOPIC . To disable MQTT, set mqen=0 , which preserves the other values, allowing you to easily switch between enabling and disabling MQTT without the loss of other parameters. Published Message Explanation /OGTOPIC/OUT/NOTIFY Published upon changes in door status, including just OPENED , just CLOSED , or just STOPPED . /OGTOPIC/OUT/STATUS Report device online/offline status. /OGTOPIC/OUT/STATE Published every 15 seconds to report the current state, including OPEN , CLOSED , STOPPED . /OGTOPIC/OUT/JSON Published every 15 seconds and reports the same controller variables as the /jc endpoint Subscribed Message : The controller subscribes to topic /OGTOPIC/IN/STATE and accepts the following payload messages: click : Toggle door close : Trigger door close action open : Trigger door open action togglelight : Toggle light. Supported only for Security+ 2.0/1.0 togglelock : Toggle remote lock. Supported only for Security+ 2.0/1.0 10. Cloud Connection The cloud connection type is defined by the cld option . Two types are supported: Blynk and OTC. Blynk As the Blynk team officially ended support for their legacy app and server, we provide a replicated Blynk server at openthings.io . This allows existing users of the legacy app can continue using it for connection. Default server domain name ( bdmn ): blynk.openthings.io Default server port ( bprt ): 8080 .

Hardware and software details are all published at the OpenGarage Github repository . For additional details, video tutorials, technical support, and user forum, visit https://opengarage.io . What's New in Firmware 1.2.4? This firmware introduces support for OpenGarage v2.3+ , a new hardware version that can natively communicate with Security+ 2.0 and 1.0 openers. This direct communication enables a range of new features, including richer door status reporting and control over the opener's light and remote lock. Here is a detailed list: Auto-detection of Security+ 2.0/1.0. Reporting a complete list of door states: closed, open, stopped (partially open), closing, opening. Control opener's light and remote lock (enable/disable garage remotes). Obstruction sensor reporting. Wall-panel emulation for Security+ 1.0. Redesigned AP-mode WiFi setup page with a sleek new appearance. Built-in web UI now serves minified and compressed assets for quicker loads and reduced flash usage. Firmware update progress indicator. MQTT integration and Blynk UI updated to include the extended door states, light, and remote lock controls. Backward compatibility with older OpenGarage hardware that does not have native support for Security+. Hardware Setup OpenGarage is not waterproof If installing outdoors, place it inside a waterproof enclosure . OpenGarage has a built-in ultrasonic distance sensor for detecting door status and car presence, a pushbutton, and a microUSB connector for power. Step 1: Locate Door-Button Terminals On your garage opener's motor unit , locate the terminals that connect to the wall button (also called console or door control). OpenGarage communicates with the opener through these terminals. Most openers have four terminals: Two for the wall-button \u2014 typically colored Red (Signal) and White (Ground). These are the ones OpenGarage connects to. Two for the safety sensor \u2014 typically colored Gray (Signal) and White (Ground). If you are unsure, or your terminals don't have these colors: simply identify which terminals are connected to your existing wall button, or refer to your opener\u2019s user manual. Step 2: Wiring OpenGarage v2.x has four integrated screw terminals. Flip the device over to identify the terminals on the back: The bottom two connect to your opener's wall-button terminals. These are required . The top two are optional: they can be connected to a magnetic switch sensor, or your opener's safety sensor (for sensing obstruction status). Use the two-wire cable from your OpenGarage package to connect the bottom two screws to your opener's wall-button terminals identified in Step 1 above: On OpenGarage v2.0\u20142.2 , the terminals are labeled Door Button Wire1 and Door Button Wire2 . They are non-polarized , so can be connected in either orientation. On OpenGarage v2.3+ , they are labeled Red/Pink (CTRL) and White/Green (GND) respectively. These are polarized : CTRL must go to your opener's Red (Signal) terminal GND must go to your opener's White (Ground) terminal. The included cable uses Pink and Green for internal wire colors. Use Pink as Red , and Green as White . If using your own cable, they are typically colored Red and White. Voltage Compliance v2.3+ is designed primarily for LiftMaster, Chamberlain, and Craftsman brands, which operate their wall-buttons at 12VDC. If you plan to use it with other brands, make sure your wall-button terminals output DC only , and below 20 VDC . Applying AC voltage or DC voltage above 20V can permanently damage the v2.3+ circuit. Use v2.2 instead. To connect the wires: Loosen the screws on the bottom two terminals. Strip the wire ends to an appropriate length. Then insert the stripped copper wire through the enclosure hole. Using tweezers, a small screwdriver, or needle-nose pliers, wrap the wire around the screw at least one full turn . Tighten the screw securely. Repeat for the second terminal. Trim any excess wire to ensure it doesn't touch nearby solder joints. Finally, strip the other ends of the cable and insert them into your opener's wall-button terminals, following the color guide. Step 3: Mounting The best location to mount OpenGarage is on the ceiling , with the distance sensor facing down. The ideal position depends on how the device senses the door status: For OpenGarage v2.0\u20142.2 , or v2.3+ with Security+ set to None : The device uses the distance sensor to detect the door's open status. Therefore, position the device so it has an unobstructed view of your garage door when it's open , and the top of your car when the door is closed . NOTE : When the door is open, the car status is unavailable, as the door blocks the sensor's view of the car. For OpenGarage v2.3+ with Security+ set to 2.0 or 1.0 : The device obtains the door status directly via the Security+ protocol. The distance sensor is used solely for detecting car presence. Therefore, position the device such that it has an unobstructed view of your car at all times, regardless of the door's position. NOTE : Car status remains available whether the door is open or closed. Areas to Avoid Do NOT mount the device directly above or too close to the metal garage door rail or chain. These objects can interfere with distance sensor readings. Once you've chosen a good location, use screws or strong double-sided tape to mount the device securely. Software Setup This section walks you through powering on your OpenGarage, connecting it to your WiFi network, and accessing its web interface for the first time. Step 1: Power-Up and AP Mode Plug a microUSB cable into the device and connect it to a USB power adapter. The first time it powers on (or after a WiFi/factory reset), the device creates an open WiFi Access Point (AP) named: OG_ followed by the last 6 digits of its MAC address. For example: OG_67FG8A . Use your phone, tablet, or computer to find this network and connect to it. Step 2: WiFi Configuration After connecting to the OG_ network, most smart devices will automatically prompt you to \"Sign In\". If you don't see this prompt or \"Sign In\" page, manually open a web browser and go to 192.168.4.1 . Follow the on-screen instructions (see the attached screenshot below): Either select or enter your WiFi router's name (SSID) and type its password. Host Name (Optional) : Enter a custom hostname (e.g. myog ). This makes it easy to access the device later using a domain name like http://myog.local . Security+ Detection (Optional, OpenGarage v2.3+ only) : If you have wired your v2.3+ it to your garage opener, click Detect to automatically detect the Security+ protocol version. This feature is hidden on OpenGarage v2.2 and earlier as they do not support Security+. Cloud Token (Optional) : If you already have a Blynk or OTC token (see the Cloud Connection section), enter it here. Otherwise, select No and you can configure it later. Click Submit . Upon a successful connection, you will hear a short tune from the buzzer. Your WiFi credentials are saved and the device reboots into WiFi Client Mode , where it automatically obtains a Device IP address from your router. This device IP is typically displayed at the bottom of the screen upon the completion of this step. Step 3: Access the Device Locally on Your Network Now that OpenGarage is connected to your home network, you can access it locally using its device IP. Open a browser on a smart device or computer that is connected to the same home WiFi network as OpenGarage, and enter the device IP. Device Key : To perform certain actions like triggering the door or changing settings, you need to enter a Device Key. The Default Device Key is: opendoor Finding the Device IP : If you don't know your OpenGarage's device IP, there are several ways to find it: Check your router's Client List : Log in to your WiFi router's administration page and look for a list of connected devices. The OpenGarage should appear there with its assigned IP address. mDNS : If you entered a custom Host Name during WiFi configuration (e.g. myog ), you can access it using the mDNS name http://myog.local/ (i.e. the host name followed by .local/ ). If you left the host name empty, it uses the default host name, which is OG_ followed by the last 6 digits of its MAC address (same as AP-mode SSID). In the example above, it will be http://OG_67FG8A.local/ . Audible IP : Press and hold the onboard pushbutton for 2 to 4 seconds , then release. The device will beep out its IP address using tones (see Button Actions below). Step 4: Button Actions The pushbutton on OpenGarage has several useful functions depending on how long you press it: Trigger Relay : A short click (less than 2 sec) \u2192 triggers the onboard relay and consequently garage door action. This is similar to a typical garage door wall button. Report IP : Hold 2-4 sec and release \u2192 the device IP is reported as sequences of rising notes, pauses, and high-pitch tones for dots. For example: 192.168.1.10 is beeped out as a C4 (the leading 1 ), followed by a pause; then sequence C4, C#4, D4... continuously until G#5 , indicating digit 9 , followed by a pause; then C4, C#4 and pause, indicating 2 ; then a high-pitch tone, indicating a dot; and so on. Count the number of notes in each sequence to determine the digit. Reset to AP Mode : Hold 5-9 sec until the LED toggles state (from off to on), then release \u2192 resets the device to WiFi AP Mode. This allows you to reconfigure WiFi without losing settings and log data. Factory Reset : Hold 10+ sec until the LED turns on and then off \u2192 resets the device back to factory default. This erases all settings and data, restoring the device to its original state. Step 5: Cloud Connection To control and monitor your OpenGarage remotely from anywhere, you'll need to set up a cloud connection. OpenGarage supports two cloud services: OTC (OpenThings Cloud): Allows full remote access to the built-in web UI. All features are supported except firmware upgrade. Blynk : Allows remote status checks and door control, but does not allow settings, logs, or firmware upgrade. Info For detailed instructions on setting up and using cloud services, refer to the Cloud Connection Support Article . Step 6: Browser, Mobile App, and Home Assistant Integration Browser Access OpenGarage provides a built-in web UI accessible directly from any browser using the device's local IP or hostname. Remote access via browser is also supported through the OTC cloud connection using the OTC base url . Web App A lightweight OpenGarage Web App is available for conveniently managing multiple OpenGarage devices . It supports both local access (via device IP) and remote access (via Blynk or OTC), and runs entirely in your browser \u2014 no installation required. Native App The OpenGarage Mobile App is available for installation in both the iOS App Store and Google Play. It provides a native app interface for door control, status, and multiple device management. The firmware still works with the Blynk legacy app (officially discontinued but may still be available on third-party websites). Instructions can be found here . Home Assistant Integration OpenGarage has an official Home Assistant integration that adds the device as a cover entity. It allows door control, status monitoring, and automation within Home Assistant. API and MQTT OpenGarage exposes a simple, well-documented HTTP API as well as MQTT support. You can use these to write custom scripts, integrate with third-party apps, or connect through any MQTT client. Built-in Web Interface Homepage The homepage displays a real-time overview of your device's status including: Door status Vehicle detection status Distance sensor value Switch sensor state ( if enabled ) Obstruction sensor status ( Security+ 2.0/1.0 only ) Panel Emulation mode ( Security+ 1.0 only ) WiFi Signal strength Cloud connection status Temperature/Humidity sensor readings ( if enabled ) You can also perform several key operations including: Open/Close/Toggle door Reboot Device Reset WiFi Clear Log . Toggle Light and Remote Lock ( Security+ 2.0/1.0 only ) All of these actions require the Device Key (default: opendoor ), except when accessed remotely via OTC token, where the key is not required. For convenience, the key is cached in your browser and can be cleared by clicking the \u2716 icon next to it. The homepage also provides navigation links to Edit Options , Show Log , Firmware Update , and the User Manual . Edit Options Editing any option requires the Device Key (except when accessed remotely via OTC token). Some options take effect only after a reboot \u2014 these are marked [Effective after reboot] . The options are divided into three tabs: 1. Basic Tab Device Name : A custom name shown on the homepage. Distance Sensor : How the device is mounted: Ceiling Mount (default): The most common use, where the device is mounted on the ceiling with the ultrasonic distance sensor facing down. Side Mount : For roll-up doors or when ceiling mount is not feasible: mount the device on the side of the door facing outward. Security+ Version : Available only on OpenGarage v2.3+ and applies to LiftMaster, Chamberlain, and Craftsman brands . You can typically identify the version by the color of the Learn button or antenna wire on the motor unit: 2.0 : Yellow 1.0 : Purple , Orange , or Red None : Green , or any brand not listed above Detect : If you're unsure of your version, click Detect to automatically probe and select the correct type. Danger The detection can take up to 15 seconds, and the door may activate or move during this time. Ensure the door's path is clear before proceeding. Note on Security+ 1.0 In Security+ 1.0 mode, the device emulates a smart wall panel by sending rapid probing signals needed to obtain door status (unless an existing smart wall panel is detected). This disables traditional, non-smart wall-buttons. If this restriction is undesirable, please disable Security+ mode by setting it to None . NOTE : Security+ 2.0 systems are not affected as they do not require panel emulation. Door Threshold : Distance (in cm ) used to determine if the door is open. Set it larger than the distance from the ceiling to the door when fully open, but smaller than the ceiling-to-car distance. Example: if the distance from ceiling to the fully-open door is 30 cm, set the threshold to 50 cm to provide a reliable margin. This option is only available if Security+ Version is None . For Security+ 2.0/1.0, the door status is obtained from the Security+ protocol and not by the distance sensor. Car Threshold : Distance (in cm ) used to determine if a car is detected. Set it larger than the ceiling-to-car distance, but smaller than ceiling-to-ground distance. The diagram below illustrates how to set the Door and Car thresholds. Status Check Interval : How often (in seconds ) the device checks all sensors. Default: 1 . Click Time : Duration (in ms ) the relay is held when triggered. Default: 1000 ms . Switch Sensor : ( only available if Security+ Version is None ) Configure an optional magnetic sensor (connected between pin G04 and GND ) for door detection. Options: Normally Closed : most common type; switch is closed/shorted when door is closed Normally Open : switch is open when door is closed Sensor Logic : ( only available if Security+ Version is None ) If a switch sensor is enabled, you can define how the distance and switch sensors together determine the door status: Distance Sensor Only Switch Sensor Only Distance AND Switch \u2014 door considered open only if both sensors report open Distance OR Switch \u2014 door considered open if either reports open T/H Sensor [Effective after reboot] : Select the type of optional temperature/humidity sensor (requires soldering). Supported sensors: DHT11/DHT22 (data pin on G05 ) DS18B20 (data pin on G05 , requires 10 k\u03a9 pull-up resistor) The sensor must be powered by VCC (3.3 V) and GND Sound Alarm : Set the duration for the audible alarm before each door movement. Includes an option to disable the alarm specifically for door opening. Log Size : Number of log records to retain. After changing, go to the homepage and click Clear Log for it to take effect. 2. Integration Tab Enable Cloud Connection [effective after reboot] : Select Blynk or OTC for cloud service, and enter the Cloud Token . The default Cloud Server / Port are: Blynk: blynk.openthings.io , port 8080 OTC: ws.cloud.openthings.io , port 80 Enable MQTT : Enable MQTT communication by provide the MQTT server URL, port, credentials (optional), and a custom MQTT topic. If topic is left blank, the device name is used. Enable Email Notifications : Set up email notifications by providing an SMTP server, credentials, and recipient address. For detailed instructions, refer to the Setting Up Email Notifications Support Article . Info When using MQTT or Email Notifications, please ensure all fields are correct. Empty or incorrect values may cause the device to become unresponsive. IFTTT Key : Webhook service key for IFTTT integration. Create an IFTTT account, search \"Webhook\" service and create a key, then copy your key here. You can then create applets triggered by the opengarage event name, with SMS, email, or push notification as the action. The notification message is passed via parameter value1 . Choose Notification Events : Select which events generate notifications. Applies to all of Blynk, Email, IFTTT, and MQTT. Automation : Set up rules to automatically notify you or close the door if it has been left open beyond a certain amount of time, or past a specific UTC time. Time is in UTC, as the controller does not know your local timezone. Example: to close at 6 PM local (UTC-4), set 22 (6 PM + 4 h = 22 UTC). A minimum 5-second sound alarm is enforced before auto-close. 3. Advanced Tab Read Interval [effective after reboot] : Time (in ms ) between ultrasonic distance sensor readings. Default: 500 ms . Increasing this value can help reduce noise. Sensor Filter method: Median : Use median of the last 7 readings. Consensus : Average the last 7 readings if their range (max\u2013min) \u2264 margin ; otherwise ignores until stable. Margin defines the range tolerance (default: 10 cm ). If Consensus fails often, increase margin (e.g. 20 cm ) or switch to Median filter. Distance Timeout : How to handle ultrasonic sensor timeout: Ignore (default): Ignore invalid readings to reduce noise. Cap at the maximum which is 450 cm . HTTP Port [effective after reboot] : Custom web server port (default: 80 ). Hostname [effective after reboot] : Custom local hostname.

This direct communication enables a range of new features, including richer door status reporting and control over the opener's light and remote lock. Here is a detailed list: Auto-detection of Security+ 2.0/1.0. Reporting a complete list of door states: closed, open, stopped (partially open), closing, opening. Control opener's light and remote lock (enable/disable garage remotes). Obstruction sensor reporting. Wall-panel emulation for Security+ 1.0. Redesigned AP-mode WiFi setup page with a sleek new appearance. Built-in web UI now serves minified and compressed assets for quicker loads and reduced flash usage. Firmware update progress indicator. MQTT integration and Blynk UI updated to include the extended door states, light, and remote lock controls. Backward compatibility with older OpenGarage hardware that does not have native support for Security+.","title":"What's New in Firmware 1.2.4?"},{"location":"1.2.4/manual/#hardware-setup","text":"OpenGarage is not waterproof If installing outdoors, place it inside a waterproof enclosure . OpenGarage has a built-in ultrasonic distance sensor for detecting door status and car presence, a pushbutton, and a microUSB connector for power.","title":"Hardware Setup"},{"location":"1.2.4/manual/#step-1-locate-door-button-terminals","text":"On your garage opener's motor unit , locate the terminals that connect to the wall button (also called console or door control). OpenGarage communicates with the opener through these terminals. Most openers have four terminals: Two for the wall-button \u2014 typically colored Red (Signal) and White (Ground). These are the ones OpenGarage connects to. Two for the safety sensor \u2014 typically colored Gray (Signal) and White (Ground). If you are unsure, or your terminals don't have these colors: simply identify which terminals are connected to your existing wall button, or refer to your opener\u2019s user manual.","title":"Step 1: Locate Door-Button Terminals"},{"location":"1.2.4/manual/#step-2-wiring","text":"OpenGarage v2.x has four integrated screw terminals. Flip the device over to identify the terminals on the back: The bottom two connect to your opener's wall-button terminals. These are required . The top two are optional: they can be connected to a magnetic switch sensor, or your opener's safety sensor (for sensing obstruction status). Use the two-wire cable from your OpenGarage package to connect the bottom two screws to your opener's wall-button terminals identified in Step 1 above: On OpenGarage v2.0\u20142.2 , the terminals are labeled Door Button Wire1 and Door Button Wire2 . They are non-polarized , so can be connected in either orientation. On OpenGarage v2.3+ , they are labeled Red/Pink (CTRL) and White/Green (GND) respectively. These are polarized : CTRL must go to your opener's Red (Signal) terminal GND must go to your opener's White (Ground) terminal. The included cable uses Pink and Green for internal wire colors. Use Pink as Red , and Green as White . If using your own cable, they are typically colored Red and White. Voltage Compliance v2.3+ is designed primarily for LiftMaster, Chamberlain, and Craftsman brands, which operate their wall-buttons at 12VDC. If you plan to use it with other brands, make sure your wall-button terminals output DC only , and below 20 VDC . Applying AC voltage or DC voltage above 20V can permanently damage the v2.3+ circuit. Use v2.2 instead. To connect the wires: Loosen the screws on the bottom two terminals. Strip the wire ends to an appropriate length. Then insert the stripped copper wire through the enclosure hole. Using tweezers, a small screwdriver, or needle-nose pliers, wrap the wire around the screw at least one full turn . Tighten the screw securely. Repeat for the second terminal. Trim any excess wire to ensure it doesn't touch nearby solder joints. Finally, strip the other ends of the cable and insert them into your opener's wall-button terminals, following the color guide.","title":"Step 2: Wiring"},{"location":"1.2.4/manual/#step-3-mounting","text":"The best location to mount OpenGarage is on the ceiling , with the distance sensor facing down. The ideal position depends on how the device senses the door status: For OpenGarage v2.0\u20142.2 , or v2.3+ with Security+ set to None : The device uses the distance sensor to detect the door's open status. Therefore, position the device so it has an unobstructed view of your garage door when it's open , and the top of your car when the door is closed . NOTE : When the door is open, the car status is unavailable, as the door blocks the sensor's view of the car. For OpenGarage v2.3+ with Security+ set to 2.0 or 1.0 : The device obtains the door status directly via the Security+ protocol. The distance sensor is used solely for detecting car presence. Therefore, position the device such that it has an unobstructed view of your car at all times, regardless of the door's position. NOTE : Car status remains available whether the door is open or closed. Areas to Avoid Do NOT mount the device directly above or too close to the metal garage door rail or chain. These objects can interfere with distance sensor readings. Once you've chosen a good location, use screws or strong double-sided tape to mount the device securely.","title":"Step 3: Mounting"},{"location":"1.2.4/manual/#software-setup","text":"This section walks you through powering on your OpenGarage, connecting it to your WiFi network, and accessing its web interface for the first time.","title":"Software Setup"},{"location":"1.2.4/manual/#step-1-power-up-and-ap-mode","text":"Plug a microUSB cable into the device and connect it to a USB power adapter. The first time it powers on (or after a WiFi/factory reset), the device creates an open WiFi Access Point (AP) named: OG_ followed by the last 6 digits of its MAC address. For example: OG_67FG8A . Use your phone, tablet, or computer to find this network and connect to it.","title":"Step 1: Power-Up and AP Mode"},{"location":"1.2.4/manual/#step-2-wifi-configuration","text":"After connecting to the OG_ network, most smart devices will automatically prompt you to \"Sign In\". If you don't see this prompt or \"Sign In\" page, manually open a web browser and go to 192.168.4.1 . Follow the on-screen instructions (see the attached screenshot below): Either select or enter your WiFi router's name (SSID) and type its password. Host Name (Optional) : Enter a custom hostname (e.g. myog ). This makes it easy to access the device later using a domain name like http://myog.local . Security+ Detection (Optional, OpenGarage v2.3+ only) : If you have wired your v2.3+ it to your garage opener, click Detect to automatically detect the Security+ protocol version. This feature is hidden on OpenGarage v2.2 and earlier as they do not support Security+. Cloud Token (Optional) : If you already have a Blynk or OTC token (see the Cloud Connection section), enter it here. Otherwise, select No and you can configure it later. Click Submit . Upon a successful connection, you will hear a short tune from the buzzer. Your WiFi credentials are saved and the device reboots into WiFi Client Mode , where it automatically obtains a Device IP address from your router. This device IP is typically displayed at the bottom of the screen upon the completion of this step.","title":"Step 2: WiFi Configuration"},{"location":"1.2.4/manual/#step-3-access-the-device-locally-on-your-network","text":"Now that OpenGarage is connected to your home network, you can access it locally using its device IP. Open a browser on a smart device or computer that is connected to the same home WiFi network as OpenGarage, and enter the device IP. Device Key : To perform certain actions like triggering the door or changing settings, you need to enter a Device Key. The Default Device Key is: opendoor Finding the Device IP : If you don't know your OpenGarage's device IP, there are several ways to find it: Check your router's Client List : Log in to your WiFi router's administration page and look for a list of connected devices. The OpenGarage should appear there with its assigned IP address. mDNS : If you entered a custom Host Name during WiFi configuration (e.g. myog ), you can access it using the mDNS name http://myog.local/ (i.e. the host name followed by .local/ ). If you left the host name empty, it uses the default host name, which is OG_ followed by the last 6 digits of its MAC address (same as AP-mode SSID). In the example above, it will be http://OG_67FG8A.local/ . Audible IP : Press and hold the onboard pushbutton for 2 to 4 seconds , then release.

This is similar to a typical garage door wall button. Report IP : Hold 2-4 sec and release \u2192 the device IP is reported as sequences of rising notes, pauses, and high-pitch tones for dots. For example: 192.168.1.10 is beeped out as a C4 (the leading 1 ), followed by a pause; then sequence C4, C#4, D4... continuously until G#5 , indicating digit 9 , followed by a pause; then C4, C#4 and pause, indicating 2 ; then a high-pitch tone, indicating a dot; and so on. Count the number of notes in each sequence to determine the digit. Reset to AP Mode : Hold 5-9 sec until the LED toggles state (from off to on), then release \u2192 resets the device to WiFi AP Mode. This allows you to reconfigure WiFi without losing settings and log data. Factory Reset : Hold 10+ sec until the LED turns on and then off \u2192 resets the device back to factory default.

Distance Sensor : How the device is mounted: Ceiling Mount (default): The most common use, where the device is mounted on the ceiling with the ultrasonic distance sensor facing down. Side Mount : For roll-up doors or when ceiling mount is not feasible: mount the device on the side of the door facing outward. Security+ Version : Available only on OpenGarage v2.3+ and applies to LiftMaster, Chamberlain, and Craftsman brands . You can typically identify the version by the color of the Learn button or antenna wire on the motor unit: 2.0 : Yellow 1.0 : Purple , Orange , or Red None : Green , or any brand not listed above Detect : If you're unsure of your version, click Detect to automatically probe and select the correct type. Danger The detection can take up to 15 seconds, and the door may activate or move during this time. Ensure the door's path is clear before proceeding. Note on Security+ 1.0 In Security+ 1.0 mode, the device emulates a smart wall panel by sending rapid probing signals needed to obtain door status (unless an existing smart wall panel is detected). This disables traditional, non-smart wall-buttons. If this restriction is undesirable, please disable Security+ mode by setting it to None . NOTE : Security+ 2.0 systems are not affected as they do not require panel emulation. Door Threshold : Distance (in cm ) used to determine if the door is open. Set it larger than the distance from the ceiling to the door when fully open, but smaller than the ceiling-to-car distance. Example: if the distance from ceiling to the fully-open door is 30 cm, set the threshold to 50 cm to provide a reliable margin. This option is only available if Security+ Version is None . For Security+ 2.0/1.0, the door status is obtained from the Security+ protocol and not by the distance sensor. Car Threshold : Distance (in cm ) used to determine if a car is detected. Set it larger than the ceiling-to-car distance, but smaller than ceiling-to-ground distance. The diagram below illustrates how to set the Door and Car thresholds. Status Check Interval : How often (in seconds ) the device checks all sensors. Default: 1 . Click Time : Duration (in ms ) the relay is held when triggered. Default: 1000 ms .
